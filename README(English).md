# Daily-Agenda

## Overview
Daily-Agenda is an online agenda system that automatically sends tomorrow’s timetable and homework to classmates via email.  
The goal is to help both students and teachers by reducing confusion about class schedules and assignments.

## Why I Created
When I was a high school student in Japan, our teachers distributed monthly event schedules on paper.  
I found it strange that we received paper documents even though every student was required to own a laptop.  
In today’s digital and sustainable society, I felt it was important to reduce unnecessary paper use and digitalize such processes.  
Moreover, many classmates often asked what the next class or homework was, so I thought an automated digital agenda could be a great solution.

## Materials Used
- Gmail (my personal account + class group address)  
- Google Spreadsheet  
- Google Colaboratory (Python)

## What I Devised
Google Colaboratory’s Python environment has several unique characteristics that required a lot of research (this was before generative AI became common).  
I studied the necessary libraries and implemented the program efficiently.  
From a user perspective, I also designed the email layout carefully to look good on both PCs and smartphones.

## What I Could Improve
At the time, I was still inexperienced, and my code ended up exceeding 300 lines.  
With more algorithmic thinking and modularization, I could have significantly reduced the length and improved maintainability.

## Reflection
Through this project, I learned the importance of usability and sustainable design, as well as how to translate small inconveniences into digital solutions.

## About in the GitHub
This project was created when I was highschool student using my school account; therefore, it doesn't work anymore.
Thanks to the friend of mine, he left me a image of the project which I'm posting it rather than creating samething from one.
