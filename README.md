# Daily-Agenda
## What I created
The project I created is basically an online agenda, that send out classmates what the tomorrow's timetable and the 
homework is. I aim to help both classmates and teachers so that there will be less concerns about what has to be done.
## Why I created
When I was a high school student in Japan, our teacher always send a paper of a monthly event. I had a tingle 
that made me curious why they send us a paperwork when we all have our laptop forced to buy.
In this SDGs society + information society, I thought digitalizing something we don't need is important.
In addition, there were a lot of classmates asking what the next class is and what the homework was so I thought 
sending it as an Agenda will be a great idea.
## Materials
- Gmail (my account and the group address of my class)
- Google Spreadsheet
- Google Colabolatory (Python)
## What I devised
Google colaboratory's python is a little unique that there were lot of things that required research (GAI was not widespread at that time),
